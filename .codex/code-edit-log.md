## Torch-OSQP dense reference migration

- Status: planned
- Start local time: 2026-06-23 21:55:52 -05:00
- End local time: 2026-06-23 21:56:06 CDT-0500
- Duration: Not recorded

### Goal

- Implement the approved dense-LU Torch-OSQP architecture, validation pipeline, support policy, research archive, and revised PDF.

### What changed

- `git status`: ?? pygranso/private/osqpTorchAdapter.py
- `git status`: ?? pygranso/private/torchOSQP.py
- `git status`: ?? test_osqp_torch_adapter.py

### What was found

- The PyGRANSO worktree already contains uncommitted sparse-CG, CUDA Graph, adapter, benchmark, documentation, and test work that must be preserved before refactoring.
- The requested migration spans source, tests, documentation, generated evidence, Git archive references, and a rendered PDF.

### Validation

- None

### Conclusion

- None

### Next steps

**Codex can proceed:**

- Validate and archive the current research snapshot, then implement and verify the approved migration without resetting user changes.

**Human reflection:**

- The signed archive tag depends on an available Git signing key; this will be tested and reported rather than silently downgraded.

### Human action

- None

## Torch-OSQP dense reference migration completed

- Status: completed
- Start local time: 2026-06-23T21:55:52-05:00
- End local time: 2026-06-24 11:58:45 CDT-0500
- Duration: approximately 14h 2m

### Goal

- Implement and validate the approved dense-LU Torch-OSQP architecture, backend policy, evidence pipeline, CI gates, research archive, and revised PDF.

### What changed

- Created archive branch archive/sparse-cg-cuda-graph at commit da142c1 and preserved the research snapshot; a signed tag was not created because no signing key is configured.
- Replaced the package Torch solver with reusable DenseLUSolver, dense direct ADMM, Ruiz scaling, deterministic adaptive rho, strict polishing, warm starts, validation, and optimizer-owned TorchOSQPWorkspace state.
- Reworked osqpTorchAdapter.py, solveQP.py, bfgssqp.py, qpTerminationCondition.py, and public options for the three-value backend policy, full fallback telemetry, strict input contracts, and per-run workspace invalidation.
- Replaced legacy tests with deterministic, differential, workspace, metamorphic, randomized, and B1/B2/B3 end-to-end coverage; added Linux/Windows/macOS core and nightly CI workflows.
- Added dense benchmark and stability evidence generators plus local CPU/CUDA CSV, JSON, Markdown, and performance artifacts under output/.
- Revised README and technical documentation; added a maintained engineering specification and rendered the visually checked 10-page revised PDF.
- Disabled the legacy bench_osqp_runtime.py entry point in favor of bench_osqp_dense_reference.py; the executable research version remains on the archive branch.

### What was found

- Strict polishing exposed two real defects: refinement was applied to the regularized rather than exact KKT system, and duplicate equality/bound active rows made the dual split nonunique. Exact-KKT polishing plus equality-first duplicate removal fixed both.
- PyGRANSO stationarity QPs created a float32 equality RHS under double precision, and an unindexed cuda target was compared literally with cuda:0. Canonical dtype/device handling fixed B1/B2/B3 Torch CPU and CUDA runs.
- Float32 cannot honestly support the float64 conditioning envelope at 1e-5 tolerances; it is now qualified to an estimated scaled-KKT condition near 1e2, while float64 remains authoritative through about 1e8.
- Local NVIDIA correctness passed, but B1/B2/B3 Torch CUDA medians were 14.4x to 20.0x builtin CPU runtime, so CUDA correctly remains unpromoted for auto selection.

### Validation

- Baseline legacy adapter suite: 79 passed before refactoring.
- Final deterministic/differential/metamorphic/end-to-end suite: 59 passed; one unrelated NumPy deprecation warning.
- Ruff static check passed for package, tests, benchmarks, stability generator, and PDF renderer.
- Windows CPU float64 stability: 300/300 passed; Windows CPU qualified float32: 200/200 passed.
- NVIDIA CUDA float64: 220/220 passed; NVIDIA CUDA qualified float32: 200/200 passed.
- B1/B2/B3 builtin-vs-Torch observables agreed; CUDA performance promotion gate failed at 20.0x, 14.4x, and 15.8x slowdown.
- Workflow YAML parsed successfully; revised PDF rendered to 10 pages, contained the required text, and passed page-by-page visual inspection.

### Conclusion

- The dense Torch reference pipeline is implemented and locally validated within its stated Windows CPU/CUDA and dtype-specific numerical envelopes; no accelerator is auto-promoted without its remaining release gates.

### Next steps

**Codex can proceed:**

- Run and inspect the new GitHub Actions matrix on Linux, Windows, macOS, PyTorch 2.8, and current stable.
- Optimize or replace the CUDA dense backend behind the same factorize/solve boundary before reconsidering automatic promotion.

**Human reflection:**

- The conservative float32 conditioning limit is intentional evidence-based scoping, not a tolerance relaxation; decide whether float32 should remain public or be described as experimental.
- CUDA correctness is strong, but automatic selection would currently be a severe performance regression.

### Human action

- Configure a Git signing key, then create signed tag research-sparse-cg-cuda-graph-final at da142c1.
- Review and commit the feature/torch-osqp-dense-reference worktree, then run the configured CI workflows before release.
- Provide real ROCm and Apple MPS runners before making either backend support claim.

## Torch-OSQP artifact cleanup bookkeeping

- Status: completed
- Start local time: 2026-06-24T12:00:00-05:00
- End local time: 2026-06-24 11:59:25 CDT-0500
- Duration: approximately 2m

### Goal

- Keep superseded local evidence and PDF render scratch out of the implementation handoff.

### What changed

- Updated .gitignore with exact paths for temporary PDF renders and superseded failed/smoke evidence runs; final PDF and release evidence remain visible under output/.

### What was found

- The managed workspace ACL prevented deleting generated binary artifacts, so exact ignore rules were used without hiding the final evidence directories.

### Validation

- git status no longer reports tmp/; final output/ remains available for review.

### Conclusion

- The handoff is cleanly scoped despite sandbox-owned generated files remaining on disk.

### Next steps

**Codex can proceed:**

- None

**Human reflection:**

- None

### Human action

- None

## Torch-OSQP final diff hygiene

- Status: completed
- Start local time: 2026-06-24T12:02:00-05:00
- End local time: 2026-06-24 12:00:11 CDT-0500
- Duration: under 1m

### Goal

- Remove the final whitespace defect reported by git diff --check.

### What changed

- Removed the extra trailing blank line from pygranso/private/solveQP.py.

### What was found

- git diff --check reported one new blank line at EOF.

### Validation

- git diff --check passed after the edit; only a line-ending informational warning remains for the archived benchmark stub.

### Conclusion

- The implementation diff has no whitespace errors.

### Next steps

**Codex can proceed:**

- None

**Human reflection:**

- None

### Human action

- None

## Torch-OSQP completion audit

- Status: planned
- Start local time: 2026-06-24T12:01:40-05:00
- End local time: 2026-06-24 12:01:54 CDT-0500
- Duration: Not recorded

### Goal

- Prove the active pipeline goal requirement-by-requirement, correct remaining gaps, and establish clean source/evidence provenance.

### What changed

- Planned audit only; implementation files are not yet changed in this continuation.

### What was found

- The feature branch still points at the archive commit with the complete implementation uncommitted, the signed archive tag is absent, and evidence manifests identify a dirty archive-base worktree.

### Validation

- Initial git status and branch/tag inspection completed.

### Conclusion

- Completion is not yet proven; a full audit and provenance cleanup are required.

### Next steps

**Codex can proceed:**

- Audit source, tests, evidence, PDF, CI, and signing state against every explicit requirement.

**Human reflection:**

- The requested signed tag must represent a real configured signing identity; it must not be faked with an ephemeral key.

### Human action

- None at this checkpoint.

## Torch-OSQP completion audit and final evidence

- Status: completed
- Start local time: 2026-06-24T12:01:40-05:00
- End local time: 2026-06-24 12:44:55 CDT-0500
- Duration: 42m 30s

### Goal

- Implement and validate the revised dense Torch-OSQP development and validation pipeline, correct audit gaps, produce the revised PDF and release evidence, and report any promotion blockers honestly.

### What changed

- pygranso/private/torchLinearSolve.py and torchOSQP.py: implemented finite-checked reusable LU, dense KKT ADMM, Ruiz scaling, deterministic adaptive rho, strict polishing, warm starts, and diagnostics.
- pygranso/private/osqpWorkspace.py and bfgssqp.py: added a private per-optimizer workspace with structural invalidation and compatible value-update reuse.
- pygranso/private/osqpTorchAdapter.py, solveQP.py, and pygransoOptions.py: implemented the public auto/builtin/torch policy, validated size/memory/device fallback telemetry, common defaults, migration errors, and explicit-Torch failure semantics.
- pygranso/private/qpTerminationCondition.py, qpSteeringStrategy.py, and bfgssqp.py: preserved original hard QP failure causes instead of masking them with secondary unpack or NoneType errors.
- tests/, torch_osqp_stability.py, bench_osqp_dense_reference.py, and bench_pygranso_osqp_workloads.py: added deterministic unit, differential, metamorphic, randomized, failure-reproduction, provenance, and B1/B2/B3 performance validation.
- .github/workflows/: added cross-platform deterministic/nightly matrices and a manual real-hardware CUDA promotion gate.
- README.md, docs/, and output/pdf/Full Development and Validation Pipeline - Revised.pdf: rewrote the pipeline as an executive summary plus decision-complete engineering specification with support matrix, risks, decisions, migration, and evidence.
- .gitignore and legacy files: isolated generated evidence, removed custom-CG/CUDA-Graph active-path artifacts, and retained the archived baseline on archive/sparse-cg-cuda-graph.

### What was found

- All locally supported differential buckets passed: CPU float64 200/200, CPU float32 200/200, CUDA float64 200/200, and CUDA float32 200/200; the 100 float64 stress cases per backend also passed.
- All 100 high-conditioning float32 stress cases failed on each backend while producing zero release-gate failures, validating a conservative float32 conditioning claim rather than the float64 1e8 guarantee.
- CUDA B1/B2/B3 outputs were equivalent to builtin CPU OSQP but median runtime was 12.48x, 21.33x, and 43.46x slower, so CUDA cannot be auto-promoted under the 5x ceiling.
- Every final evidence manifest identifies the same 84-file source tree SHA-256 43bb246bc3db8cb0f946dff106cd6a4c4e8c15e3a563be5418419c653bf3163f despite the implementation worktree being uncommitted.
- MPS float64 auto fallback needed an explicit CPU result device; hard steering/stationarity QP failures also needed cause-preserving propagation. Both gaps were corrected and regression-tested.
- The signed archive tag remains absent because no signing identity or secret key is configured; the feature worktree also remains uncommitted because the managed Git-write approval quota rejected staging.

### Validation

- python -B -m pytest -q: 71 passed; one pre-existing NumPy deprecation warning and two sandbox cache-write warnings.
- python -B -m ruff check .: passed; only cache-write and removed-rule configuration warnings.
- git diff --check: passed.
- All three GitHub Actions workflow YAML files parsed successfully.
- Final stability evidence: four 300-case manifests completed within the two-hour ceiling with zero supported release-gate failures; float32 stress failures were serialized.
- Final B1/B2/B3 five-repeat performance report completed and failed all three CUDA promotion gates while preserving benchmark equivalence.
- Revised PDF parsed as 10 pages and 33,568 bytes; all rendered page/contact-sheet visual checks were clean.

### Conclusion

- The local implementation, tests, evidence generators, support policy, documentation, and revised PDF are complete and internally consistent. Release completion is still blocked by the genuine signed archive tag, a clean feature commit/evidence provenance cycle, external OS/PyTorch CI runs, and real-hardware backend gates; CUDA is deliberately unpromoted on measured performance.

### Next steps

**Codex can proceed:**

- When Git-write approval becomes available, commit the feature worktree, regenerate the four manifests from the clean commit, and verify that their commit and fingerprint provenance agree.
- After appropriate runners are available, execute the configured Linux/macOS, PyTorch 2.8/current-stable, CUDA, ROCm, and MPS release gates and update the support matrix only for passing backends.

**Human reflection:**

- Decide whether float32 should remain a narrowly qualified convenience path or be excluded from any strong conditioning guarantee; the present evidence strongly favors narrow qualification.
- The dense CUDA implementation is correct but poorly matched to these small repeated QPs; optimization work should not weaken the current fallback-first promotion policy.

### Human action

- Configure or provide the authorized signing identity/key, then create signed tag research-sparse-cg-cuda-graph-final at da142c1641c6f14ba3eb564abe88ff16972d771a.
- Approve the Git-write operation needed to commit the implementation once the managed approval window permits it.
- Provide or authorize the external hosted and real-hardware runners required for Linux/macOS, PyTorch-version, CUDA, ROCm, and MPS release claims.

## Torch-OSQP evidence provenance correction

- Status: completed
- Start local time: 2026-06-25 09:09:54 -05:00
- End local time: 2026-06-25 09:55:49 Central Daylight Time-0500
- Duration: 45m 31s

### Goal

- Align the revised Torch-OSQP documentation, PDF, and generated evidence with the final CUDA promotion results and maintained-source fingerprint.

### What changed

- README.md: replaced stale CUDA 14.4x-20.0x promotion-gate wording with final B1/B2/B3 slowdowns.
- docs/UNCONSTRAINED_AND_OSQP.md: replaced stale CUDA slowdown range with final representative workload slowdowns.
- docs/FULL_DEVELOPMENT_AND_VALIDATION_PIPELINE.md: corrected CUDA support-matrix and performance-gate numbers.
- docs/TORCH_OSQP_COMPLETION_AUDIT.md: corrected CUDA stress-seed count and condition-qualified release-gate evidence counts.
- output/pdf/Full Development and Validation Pipeline - Revised.pdf: regenerated the revised 10-page PDF from corrected Markdown.
- output/stability/*-final/: regenerated CPU/CUDA float32/float64 stability CSVs, manifests, summaries, and failure reproductions against the final maintained-source fingerprint.
- output/stability/torch_osqp_release_summary.md: corrected condition-qualified counts and final source_tree_sha256.

### What was found

- The prior roll-up summary used nominal family counts as supported counts; raw CSV release_gate/support_class fields show condition-qualified counts of 175/199/175/200 for CPU64/CPU32/CUDA64/CUDA32.
- The maintained source fingerprint includes docs/*.md, README.md, scripts, tests, workflows, and solver files, so documentation corrections require regenerated stability manifests for exact provenance.
- CUDA correctness remains passing inside the local supported envelope, but performance evidence still fails the <=5x auto-promotion gate at 12.48x, 21.33x, and 43.46x builtin CPU runtime.

### Validation

- python -B -m pytest -q: 71 passed; warnings limited to pre-existing NumPy deprecation and sandbox cache-write warnings.
- python -B -m ruff check .: passed; warnings limited to removed UP038 ignore and sandbox cache-write warnings.
- git diff --check: passed.
- Workflow YAML parse for torch-osqp-core.yml, torch-osqp-cuda-promotion.yml, and torch-osqp-nightly.yml: passed.
- PDF regeneration and checks: 10 pages; TOC/support/risk/decision/migration sections present; final CUDA numbers present; stale CUDA numbers absent; PyMuPDF contact sheet visually checked.
- Stability regeneration: CPU float64 300 cases/0 numerical failures/0 release-gate failures; CPU float32 300 cases/100 non-gating stress failures/0 release-gate failures; CUDA float64 300 cases/0 numerical failures/0 release-gate failures; CUDA float32 300 cases/100 non-gating stress failures/0 release-gate failures.
- Source fingerprint consistency: current source_tree_sha256 3ca16e2225a62e3c4eecf82b9ae3443d4c75745016b45c8c324fa2cf8cca33fe matches all four final manifests and the roll-up summary.

### Conclusion

- The local implementation, revised documentation/PDF, and regenerated evidence package are internally consistent and validated; release closure is still blocked by a Git index lock/live Git processes, the missing signed-tag identity, and external runner gates.

### Next steps

**Codex can proceed:**

- After the active Git processes exit and the stale `.git/index.lock` is safely cleared, stage and commit the feature branch; after a real signing identity is configured, create the signed research archive tag.

**Human reflection:**

- Float32 support remains intentionally narrower than float64; the evidence now makes the condition-qualified versus stress distinction explicit instead of hiding it behind family totals.

### Human action

- Confirm no Git operation is active, clear the stale `.git/index.lock` if appropriate, provide or configure a real Git signing identity for the required signed archive tag, and run hosted Linux/Windows/macOS plus PyTorch-version and real-hardware backend gates before release promotion.

## Torch-OSQP clean evidence regeneration

- Status: completed
- Start local time: 2026-06-27 10:11:44 -05:00
- End local time: 2026-06-27 10:39:55 CDT-0500
- Duration: Not recorded

### Goal

- Remove unrelated npm artifacts and regenerate final Torch-OSQP stability evidence from the clean feature commit while keeping generated artifacts local.

### What changed

- node_modules/: removed untracked headroom-ai dependency tree after user approval.
- package.json: removed unrelated untracked npm manifest after user approval.
- package-lock.json: removed unrelated untracked npm lockfile after user approval.
- output/stability/windows-cpu-float64-final/: regenerated local final CPU float64 stability CSV, manifest, summary, and failure directory.
- output/stability/windows-cpu-float32-final/: regenerated local final CPU float32 stability CSV, manifest, summary, and failure reproductions.
- output/stability/nvidia-cuda-float64-final/: regenerated local final CUDA float64 stability CSV, manifest, summary, and failure directory.
- output/stability/nvidia-cuda-float32-final/: regenerated local final CUDA float32 stability CSV, manifest, summary, and failure reproductions.
- output/stability/torch_osqp_release_summary.md: updated provenance text to feature commit af052f4 and clean worktree.

### What was found

- The untracked npm artifacts were unrelated to Torch-OSQP and were the only visible worktree dirt before regeneration.
- The first sandboxed deletion attempt was denied by Windows permissions; escalated deletion succeeded after resolving and verifying all targets under the PyGRANSO repo.
- All regenerated final manifests now record git_commit af052f4bcf8e47e2b4c4cdd7654535c758534446, git_dirty=false, source_file_count=84, and source_tree_sha256=3ca16e2225a62e3c4eecf82b9ae3443d4c75745016b45c8c324fa2cf8cca33fe.
- CUDA correctness remains locally passing inside the release-gate envelope, but existing performance evidence still keeps CUDA unpromoted.

### Validation

- python -B torch_osqp_stability.py --device cpu --dtype float64 --seeds 100 --stress-seeds 100 --time-limit-seconds 7200 --output output/stability/windows-cpu-float64-final: 300 cases, 0 numerical failures, 0 release-gate failures.
- python -B torch_osqp_stability.py --device cpu --dtype float32 --seeds 100 --stress-seeds 100 --time-limit-seconds 7200 --output output/stability/windows-cpu-float32-final: 300 cases, 100 expected non-gating stress failures, 0 release-gate failures.

- python -B -m pytest -q: 71 passed; warnings limited to existing NumPy deprecation and cache-permission warnings.
- python -B -m ruff check .: passed; warnings limited to removed UP038 ignore and ruff cache-permission warnings.
- Manifest provenance check: all four final manifests match the current maintained source hash, feature commit af052f4, and git_dirty=false.
- git status --short --branch and git diff --check before report append: branch clean against origin; npm artifacts absent.

### Conclusion

- The confirmed cleanup and clean-commit evidence regeneration are complete; generated artifacts remain local/ignored, and only the required code-edit log update is a tracked local change.

### Next steps

**Codex can proceed:**

- If asked, stage and commit the code-edit log update or rerun/inspect additional release evidence.

**Human reflection:**

- The stability evidence is now cleaner for release review because manifests point to the feature commit instead of relying only on a source-tree hash from a dirty pre-commit state.

### Human action

- Configure a real Git signing identity and create the signed archive tag research-sparse-cg-cuda-graph-final at da142c1; run hosted CPU/PyTorch-version CI and real-hardware backend gates before release promotion.

## Torch-OSQP audit provenance refresh

- Status: completed
- Start local time: 2026-06-28 17:56:40 -05:00
- End local time: 2026-06-28 18:23:14 CDT-0500
- Duration: Not recorded

### Goal

- Refresh stale completion-audit provenance wording and regenerate final stability evidence from the clean updated docs commit.

### What changed

- docs/TORCH_OSQP_COMPLETION_AUDIT.md: updated audit date and replaced stale pre-feature-commit provenance wording with clean-feature-commit/source-hash wording.
- output/stability/windows-cpu-float64-final/: regenerated local final CPU float64 stability evidence after the audit-doc change.
- output/stability/windows-cpu-float32-final/: regenerated local final CPU float32 stability evidence after the audit-doc change.
- output/stability/nvidia-cuda-float64-final/: regenerated local final CUDA float64 stability evidence after the audit-doc change.
- output/stability/nvidia-cuda-float32-final/: regenerated local final CUDA float32 stability evidence after the audit-doc change.
- output/stability/torch_osqp_release_summary.md: updated local ignored roll-up provenance to commit cdbad24 and source hash f7206b5a6c501ca1a58acfdd27686941b55e87977a2ada4db3186ee27e63e717.

### What was found

- The completion audit still claimed manifests identified a dirty source tree before a human-created feature commit; that was stale after the report and evidence regeneration commits.
- Because docs/*.md are part of the maintained-source fingerprint, refreshing the audit doc required regenerating all final evidence buckets to keep manifest provenance exact.
- All regenerated final manifests now record git_commit cdbad242fbc3649a4f9ba765d10ce63a02b7f71c, git_dirty=false, source_file_count=84, and source_tree_sha256=f7206b5a6c501ca1a58acfdd27686941b55e87977a2ada4db3186ee27e63e717.

- Manifest provenance check: all four final manifests match commit cdbad24, git_dirty=false, and current maintained-source hash f7206b5a6c501ca1a58acfdd27686941b55e87977a2ada4db3186ee27e63e717.
- git diff --check: passed.

### Conclusion

- The tracked completion audit and local ignored evidence are now consistent with the clean updated docs commit; the implementation remains locally validated.

### Next steps

**Codex can proceed:**

- If signing is configured, create the signed archive tag; if remote authorization is provided, push the local follow-up commits.

**Human reflection:**

- The evidence package is now easier to audit because the completion audit no longer describes an earlier dirty-worktree phase.

### Human action

- Configure a real Git signing identity and create signed tag research-sparse-cg-cuda-graph-final at da142c1; run hosted CPU/PyTorch-version CI and real-hardware backend gates before release promotion.

## Torch-OSQP release audit and evidence refresh

- Status: completed
- Start local time: 2026-07-01 14:20:00 CDT-0500 (approx.)
- End local time: 2026-07-01 19:22:24 Central Daylight Time-0500
- Duration: approximately 5h

### Goal

- Clear the signed-tag/CI blockers, refresh the Torch-OSQP audit and stability evidence, and identify any remaining backend promotion blockers.

### What changed

- docs/TORCH_OSQP_COMPLETION_AUDIT.md: updated signed archive tag, hosted core CI, workflow-registration, CUDA promotion, and remaining-release-action status.
- torch_osqp_stability.py: moved stability conditioning estimation to a deterministic CPU dense initial-KKT diagnostic while keeping backend solves on the requested device.
- docs/FULL_DEVELOPMENT_AND_VALIDATION_PIPELINE.md: documented CPU-side condition diagnostics for stability artifacts.
- output/stability/windows-cpu-float64-final/: regenerated local ignored 300-case CPU float64 final evidence at commit 02e24fb.
- output/stability/windows-cpu-float32-final/: regenerated local ignored 300-case CPU float32 final evidence at commit 02e24fb.
- output/stability/nvidia-cuda-float64-final/: regenerated local ignored 300-case CUDA float64 final evidence at commit 02e24fb.
- output/stability/nvidia-cuda-float32-qualified-final/: regenerated local ignored 200-case CUDA float32 supported-family evidence at commit 02e24fb.
- output/stability/torch_osqp_release_summary.md: refreshed local ignored roll-up summary for current evidence and the CUDA float32 stress timeout.

### What was found

- The signed archive tag research-sparse-cg-cuda-graph-final verifies with key 913CC0E29352B362D9116C59387554B041B0ACDD, points to da142c1, and is present on origin.
- Hosted core workflow run 28492270655 passed all seven Linux, Windows, and macOS CPU jobs on the feature branch.
- Nightly and CUDA promotion workflows exist on the feature branch but cannot be externally dispatched until they are present on the repository default branch.
- Accelerator-side condition estimation made CUDA float64 evidence impractically slow; estimating the dense initial KKT condition on CPU preserves deterministic diagnostics without exercising slow accelerator condition kernels.
- CPU float64, CPU float32, and CUDA float64 full buckets completed with zero release-gate failures; CUDA float32 supported-family evidence also completed cleanly.
- The full CUDA float32 stress bucket exceeded the two-hour local gate on GTX 1650 and was killed before final CSV/manifest emission after writing 24 stress reproduction files; CUDA also remains unpromoted because prior end-to-end B1/B2/B3 slowdowns exceed the 5x auto-promotion ceiling.

### Validation

- git tag -v research-sparse-cg-cuda-graph-final with the configured MSYS GPG home: good signature from the configured signing identity.
- gh run view 28492270655 --repo Ztang-Yit-Xiaang/PyGRANSO: Torch OSQP core workflow succeeded across seven jobs.

- python -B torch_osqp_stability.py --device cuda --dtype float32 --seeds 100 --stress-seeds 100 --time-limit-seconds 7200 --output output/stability/nvidia-cuda-float32-final: timed out externally after exceeding the two-hour gate; no final CSV/manifest, 24 stress reproduction files retained.
- python -B -m pytest tests/test_stability_reporting.py -q: 2 passed in 4.78s.
- python -B -m ruff check torch_osqp_stability.py tests/test_stability_reporting.py docs/TORCH_OSQP_COMPLETION_AUDIT.md docs/FULL_DEVELOPMENT_AND_VALIDATION_PIPELINE.md: passed, with only the existing removed-rule warning.
- git diff --check: passed.

### Conclusion

- The signed-tag and hosted core-CI blockers are cleared, dense-LU stability evidence is refreshed locally at commit 02e24fb, and CUDA remains correctly unpromoted because the float32 stress bucket/performance promotion gates are not satisfied on the available hardware.

### Next steps

**Codex can proceed:**

- Add graceful partial CSV/manifest emission for time-limit exits in torch_osqp_stability.py, then regenerate exact-commit evidence if the user wants the reporting behavior fixed before PR.
- Open or update the release PR once the user is ready, then rerun the workflow-dispatch gates after the nightly/CUDA workflows are registered on the default branch.

**Human reflection:**

- CUDA float32 has clean supported-family correctness on the local GTX 1650, but the stress and speed gates argue against automatic promotion; treating explicit CUDA as experimental/unpromoted is the safer support boundary.
- The current stability script writes final CSV/manifest only after all cases complete, so timeout artifacts are weaker than they should be; this is a reporting robustness improvement rather than a solver-correctness issue.

### Human action

- Review and accept the CUDA support claim boundary: CPU is promoted, CUDA explicit use is available but auto remains builtin fallback until both the two-hour stress bucket and <=5x end-to-end gate pass on representative hardware.
- Merge/register the feature-branch workflows on the default branch before relying on scheduled or manual workflow_dispatch nightly/CUDA gates.
- Provide real ROCm and MPS runners before claiming those backends.

## Torch-OSQP partial evidence timeout reporting

- Status: completed
- Start local time: 2026-07-01 19:27:58 CDT-0500
- End local time: 2026-07-02 00:30:21 Central Daylight Time-0500
- Duration: approximately 5h 2m

### Goal

- Make stability evidence robust to time-limit exits, validate the new behavior, and refresh exact-source CPU evidence while keeping CUDA unpromoted.

### What changed

- torch_osqp_stability.py: added shared artifact writing for complete and partial runs; manifests now record completed_cases, planned_cases, timed_out, partial_results, and timeout_after_case when the internal time budget is exceeded.
- tests/test_stability_reporting.py: added a deterministic monkeypatched timeout test proving partial CSV, manifest, and summary artifacts are written before nonzero exit.
- docs/FULL_DEVELOPMENT_AND_VALIDATION_PIPELINE.md: documented partial timeout artifact semantics and clarified CUDA remains unpromoted when current-source gates are insufficient.
- docs/TORCH_OSQP_COMPLETION_AUDIT.md: updated CPU evidence, hosted CI run, timeout reporting, and CUDA promotion boundary status.
- output/stability/windows-cpu-float64-final/: regenerated local ignored exact-source CPU float64 evidence at e010733.
- output/stability/windows-cpu-float32-final/: regenerated local ignored exact-source CPU float32 evidence at e010733.
- output/stability/cpu-timeout-partial-smoke/: generated local ignored partial-timeout smoke artifact at e010733.
- output/stability/nvidia-cuda-float64-smoke-after-timeout/: generated local ignored CUDA float64 smoke artifact at e010733.
- output/stability/torch_osqp_release_summary.md: refreshed ignored local roll-up summary with e010733 evidence and CUDA timeout boundary.

### What was found

- The previous CUDA float32 timeout exposed a reporting gap: if a bucket missed the time gate, evidence could be lost unless the process reached normal finalization.
- The new timeout path writes CSV, manifest, and summary after a completed case exceeds the internal budget, then exits nonzero; this fixes between-case timeout telemetry but cannot save a process killed inside a single long-running case by an external wrapper.
- Clean exact-source CPU evidence at e010733 passed: float64 300/300 with zero release-gate failures in 121.95s; float32 300/300 completed with 100 expected non-gating stress failures and zero release-gate failures in 916.55s.
- The clean timeout smoke at e010733 exited 1 as intended and wrote one completed row out of three planned with timed_out=true, partial_results=true, and git_dirty=false.
- The clean CUDA float64 smoke at e010733 passed 2/2 rows in 7.48s, but larger current-source CUDA float64 reruns on the local GTX 1650 exceeded the two-hour external wrapper; CUDA remains unpromoted.
- Hosted Torch OSQP core workflow run 28566854071 passed all seven Linux, Windows, and macOS CPU jobs for e010733.

### Validation

- python -B -m pytest tests/test_stability_reporting.py -q: 3 passed.
- python -B -m ruff check torch_osqp_stability.py tests/test_stability_reporting.py docs/TORCH_OSQP_COMPLETION_AUDIT.md docs/FULL_DEVELOPMENT_AND_VALIDATION_PIPELINE.md: passed, with only the existing removed-rule warning.
- git diff --check: passed.
- GitHub Actions Torch OSQP core run 28566854071 at e010733: success across seven jobs.
- python -B torch_osqp_stability.py --device cpu --dtype float64 --seeds 100 --stress-seeds 100 --time-limit-seconds 7200 --output output/stability/windows-cpu-float64-final: 300/300, 0 release-gate failures, 121.95s.
- python -B torch_osqp_stability.py --device cpu --dtype float32 --seeds 100 --stress-seeds 100 --time-limit-seconds 7200 --output output/stability/windows-cpu-float32-final: 300/300 completed, 100 expected non-gating stress failures, 0 release-gate failures, 916.55s.
- python -B torch_osqp_stability.py --device cpu --dtype float64 --seeds 1 --stress-seeds 1 --time-limit-seconds 0.01 --output output/stability/cpu-timeout-partial-smoke: exited 1 after writing partial artifacts for 1/3 cases with timed_out=true.
- python -B torch_osqp_stability.py --device cuda --dtype float64 --seeds 1 --stress-seeds 0 --time-limit-seconds 600 --output output/stability/nvidia-cuda-float64-smoke-after-timeout: 2/2, 0 release-gate failures, 7.48s.
- CUDA float64 100-seed current-source full/qualified attempts on the local GTX 1650 exceeded the two-hour external wrapper and were stopped; no promotion claim was made from those attempts.

### Conclusion

- Partial timeout reporting is implemented, tested, documented, and pushed; exact-source CPU release evidence is refreshed at e010733; CUDA remains explicit/unpromoted pending representative hardware gates.

### Next steps

**Codex can proceed:**

- If desired, add an OS-level watchdog/progress flushing mode so external wrapper kills inside one long CUDA case still preserve a heartbeat or in-progress case marker.
- Open or update the release PR and, after workflows are merged to the default branch, run the nightly and CUDA promotion workflows there.

**Human reflection:**

- The CPU path is now well-supported by exact-source evidence; CUDA correctness has useful smokes and earlier regression evidence, but the local GTX 1650 is not representative enough to justify a stronger claim.
- The two-hour gate should be interpreted per backend bucket on representative hardware; local laptop/desktop CUDA timeouts are evidence against promotion, not evidence against CPU release readiness.

### Human action

- Review and accept the CUDA support boundary before release: CPU promoted/release-gated, CUDA explicit and unpromoted, ROCm/MPS unclaimed.
- Provide or designate representative CUDA/ROCm/MPS runners if stronger accelerator support claims are desired.
- Merge/register nightly and CUDA workflows on the default branch before relying on scheduled or manual dispatch gates.

## Torch-OSQP pipeline PDF regeneration

- Status: completed
- Start local time: 2026-07-02 00:38:06 CDT-0500
- End local time: 2026-07-02 01:03:33 Central Daylight Time-0500
- Duration: approximately 25m

### Goal

- Regenerate and visually validate the revised pipeline PDF from the current specification, fixing any rendered layout defects found.

### What changed

- scripts/render_pipeline_pdf.py: added a white bold table-header paragraph style so embedded ReportLab Paragraph cells render legibly on navy table headers.
- docs/TORCH_OSQP_COMPLETION_AUDIT.md: changed hard-coded evidence commit/hash wording to manifest-backed provenance wording so renderer/documentation follow-ups do not make the audit stale.
- output/pdf/Full Development and Validation Pipeline - Revised.pdf: regenerated the local ignored revised PDF from current Markdown; output remains local.
- tmp/pdfs/pipeline_revised_pages/: rendered 10 PNG pages for visual layout inspection.
- output/stability/windows-cpu-float64-final/: regenerated local ignored exact-source CPU float64 evidence at d9d5b9d.
- output/stability/windows-cpu-float32-final/: regenerated local ignored exact-source CPU float32 evidence at d9d5b9d.
- output/stability/cpu-timeout-partial-smoke/: regenerated local ignored timeout smoke evidence at d9d5b9d.
- output/stability/nvidia-cuda-float64-smoke-after-timeout/: regenerated local ignored CUDA float64 smoke evidence at d9d5b9d.
- output/stability/torch_osqp_release_summary.md: refreshed ignored local roll-up summary with d9d5b9d manifest provenance.

### What was found

- The repo-local revised PDF was stale relative to docs/FULL_DEVELOPMENT_AND_VALIDATION_PIPELINE.md.
- Visual inspection caught dark table-header text on the dark navy header background because ReportLab TableStyle text color did not override embedded Paragraph styles.
- After the renderer fix, the support matrix, defaults table, decision log, footer/page numbering, TOC, and dense evidence/performance page rendered legibly across the 10-page PDF.
- Because scripts and docs are included in the maintained-source fingerprint, the CPU evidence was regenerated after the renderer/audit commit; all regenerated manifests agree on clean commit d9d5b9d and source hash e6c031a0263a0cf8a0e0b10e8ee6c61eaf07687a169511c87bd4efc94df2c7f6.

### Validation

- python -B scripts/render_pipeline_pdf.py: regenerated output/pdf/Full Development and Validation Pipeline - Revised.pdf.
- PyMuPDF render of all 10 pages to tmp/pdfs/pipeline_revised_pages: succeeded; visual inspection of contact sheet plus pages 3, 7, 9, and 10 found no clipping/overlap/header contrast defects after the fix.
- pypdf extraction: 10 pages; required phrases timed_out=true, partial_results=true, Backend support matrix, Evidence package, Migration sequence, Decision log, and cuda_not_promoted were present.
- python -B -m pytest tests/test_stability_reporting.py -q: 3 passed.
- python -B -m ruff check scripts/render_pipeline_pdf.py torch_osqp_stability.py tests/test_stability_reporting.py docs/TORCH_OSQP_COMPLETION_AUDIT.md docs/FULL_DEVELOPMENT_AND_VALIDATION_PIPELINE.md: passed, with only the existing removed-rule warning.
- git diff --check: passed.
- python -B torch_osqp_stability.py --device cpu --dtype float64 --seeds 100 --stress-seeds 100 --time-limit-seconds 7200 --output output/stability/windows-cpu-float64-final: 300/300, 0 release-gate failures, 128.93s.
- python -B torch_osqp_stability.py --device cpu --dtype float32 --seeds 100 --stress-seeds 100 --time-limit-seconds 7200 --output output/stability/windows-cpu-float32-final: 300 completed, 100 expected non-gating stress failures, 0 release-gate failures, 980.50s.
- python -B torch_osqp_stability.py --device cpu --dtype float64 --seeds 1 --stress-seeds 1 --time-limit-seconds 0.01 --output output/stability/cpu-timeout-partial-smoke: exited 1 as expected after writing partial artifacts for 1/3 cases.
- python -B torch_osqp_stability.py --device cuda --dtype float64 --seeds 1 --stress-seeds 0 --time-limit-seconds 600 --output output/stability/nvidia-cuda-float64-smoke-after-timeout: 2/2, 0 release-gate failures, 9.97s.

### Conclusion

- The revised PDF artifact is regenerated from the current source and visually validated; tracked renderer/audit changes are committed and exact-source CPU evidence has been refreshed locally.

### Next steps

**Codex can proceed:**

- Update the draft PR description with the PDF-renderer fix and latest d9d5b9d evidence if desired.
- After default-branch workflow registration, run nightly and accelerator promotion workflows from GitHub Actions.

**Human reflection:**

- The manifest-backed audit wording is more robust than embedding a commit hash inside tracked docs, because docs/scripts are intentionally part of the source fingerprint.

### Human action

- Review the regenerated PDF at output/pdf/Full Development and Validation Pipeline - Revised.pdf if you want final visual approval.
- Provide representative accelerator runners before promoting CUDA/ROCm/MPS support claims.

## Torch-OSQP archive branch audit refresh

- Status: completed
- Start local time: 2026-07-02 01:07:00 CDT-0500
- End local time: 2026-07-02 01:35:34 Central Daylight Time-0500
- Duration: approximately 28m

### Goal

- Close the migration-archive evidence gap, refresh exact-source local evidence, and verify the full local solver/test suite after the latest PR work.

### What changed

- docs/TORCH_OSQP_COMPLETION_AUDIT.md: updated the research-snapshot row to state that archive/sparse-cg-cuda-graph exists both locally and on origin at da142c1.
- docs/FULL_DEVELOPMENT_AND_VALIDATION_PIPELINE.md: updated the migration sequence to say the archive branch and signed tag are created and pushed.
- output/pdf/Full Development and Validation Pipeline - Revised.pdf: regenerated the local ignored PDF after the migration-sequence wording change.
- output/stability/windows-cpu-float64-final/: regenerated local ignored exact-source CPU float64 evidence at e328fbf.
- output/stability/windows-cpu-float32-final/: regenerated local ignored exact-source CPU float32 evidence at e328fbf.
- output/stability/cpu-timeout-partial-smoke/: regenerated local ignored timeout smoke evidence at e328fbf.
- output/stability/nvidia-cuda-float64-smoke-after-timeout/: regenerated local ignored CUDA float64 smoke evidence at e328fbf.
- output/stability/torch_osqp_release_summary.md: refreshed ignored local roll-up summary with e328fbf manifest provenance.

### What was found

- The signed archive tag was already on origin, but the archive branch itself was not visible on origin; this left the migration archive evidence weaker than the requested branch-and-tag preservation.
- Pushed origin/archive/sparse-cg-cuda-graph at da142c1641c6f14ba3eb564abe88ff16972d771a.
- The signed tag research-sparse-cg-cuda-graph-final verifies with configured GNUPGHOME=/c/Users/1/AppData/Roaming/gnupg and key 913CC0E29352B362D9116C59387554B041B0ACDD.
- All refreshed local manifests agree on clean commit e328fbfc7eeba6e9aab23fce3c2e7a535ba4cd02 and source hash ab4666de0098558c7868bd995d95272a3212757f8e85619c8bae948eec0fe64b.

### Validation

- python -B -m pytest -q: 72 passed, 1 existing NumPy deprecation warning.
- python -B -m ruff check .: passed, with only the existing removed-rule warning.
- git push origin archive/sparse-cg-cuda-graph: created the origin archive branch.
- GNUPGHOME=/c/Users/1/AppData/Roaming/gnupg git tag -v research-sparse-cg-cuda-graph-final: good signature from Ztang-Yit-Xiaang.
- python -B scripts/render_pipeline_pdf.py plus pypdf extraction: regenerated 10-page PDF and confirmed migration branch/tag text, timed_out=true, and Decision log are present.
- python -B torch_osqp_stability.py --device cpu --dtype float64 --seeds 100 --stress-seeds 100 --time-limit-seconds 7200 --output output/stability/windows-cpu-float64-final: 300/300, 0 release-gate failures, 127.23s.

- python -B torch_osqp_stability.py --device cpu --dtype float64 --seeds 1 --stress-seeds 1 --time-limit-seconds 0.01 --output output/stability/cpu-timeout-partial-smoke: exited 1 as expected after writing partial artifacts for 1/3 cases.
- python -B torch_osqp_stability.py --device cuda --dtype float64 --seeds 1 --stress-seeds 0 --time-limit-seconds 600 --output output/stability/nvidia-cuda-float64-smoke-after-timeout: 2/2, 0 release-gate failures, 26.14s.
- git diff --check: passed before report append.

### Conclusion

- The migration archive branch-and-tag evidence is now complete on origin, broad local tests/lint are passing, and exact-source CPU evidence has been refreshed at e328fbf.

### Next steps

**Codex can proceed:**

- Update the draft PR body/check status after the report commit and continue monitoring CI if needed.
- If the user approves release progression, mark the draft PR ready or merge/register workflows on main; otherwise keep the branch as a green draft PR.

**Human reflection:**

- The remaining support boundary is no longer archive preservation; it is release-policy/hardware: default-branch workflow activation and representative accelerator runners.

### Human action

- Decide whether to mark the draft PR ready for review or merge it to main to register nightly/CUDA workflows.
- Provide representative CUDA/ROCm/MPS hardware if automatic accelerator promotion claims are desired.

## Torch-OSQP ruff config cleanup

- Status: completed
- Start local time: 2026-07-02 01:40:00 CDT-0500
- End local time: 2026-07-02 02:06:39 Central Daylight Time-0500
- Duration: approximately 26m

### Goal

- Remove the obsolete ruff ignore warning, revalidate focused solver/reporting paths, and refresh local exact-source evidence.

### What changed

- pyproject.toml: removed obsolete UP038 from the ruff ignore list so ruff no longer emits a removed-rule warning.
- output/stability/windows-cpu-float64-final/: regenerated local ignored exact-source CPU float64 evidence at 16bf5cf.
- output/stability/windows-cpu-float32-final/: regenerated local ignored exact-source CPU float32 evidence at 16bf5cf.
- output/stability/cpu-timeout-partial-smoke/: regenerated local ignored timeout smoke evidence at 16bf5cf.
- output/stability/nvidia-cuda-float64-smoke-after-timeout/: regenerated local ignored CUDA float64 smoke evidence at 16bf5cf.
- output/stability/torch_osqp_release_summary.md: refreshed ignored local roll-up summary with 16bf5cf manifest provenance.

### What was found

- The only ruff issue after broad validation was a configuration warning for removed rule UP038; removing it made ruff output clean.
- Because pyproject.toml is included in the maintained-source fingerprint, local evidence was regenerated after the config cleanup commit.
- All refreshed local manifests agree on clean commit 16bf5cf36d5d84aeafa0c62c6a2eb390c7722d59 and source hash c8127898905e30326dde531f637fcfa3bd84fafd3f0bf23894820f3db6cf1902.

### Validation

- python -B -m ruff check .: passed with no removed-rule warning.
- python -B -m pytest tests/test_stability_reporting.py tests/test_torch_linear_solve.py tests/test_torch_osqp_policy.py -q: 28 passed.
- python -B torch_osqp_stability.py --device cpu --dtype float64 --seeds 100 --stress-seeds 100 --time-limit-seconds 7200 --output output/stability/windows-cpu-float64-final: 300/300, 0 release-gate failures, 132.75s.

- git diff --check: passed.

### Conclusion

- The validation configuration is cleaner, focused tests and ruff are green, and exact-source local evidence is refreshed at 16bf5cf.

### Next steps

**Codex can proceed:**

- Update the draft PR body/check status after this report commit, then stop unless the user wants PR readiness/merge or accelerator hardware work.

**Human reflection:**

- This was a small cleanup, but it removed noise from the release-validation story; future ruff output is easier to interpret.

### Human action

- Decide whether to keep the PR draft, mark it ready, or merge it to main for workflow registration.
- Provide representative accelerator runners before claiming CUDA/ROCm/MPS promotion.

## Torch-OSQP roadmap and data-structure documentation

- Status: completed
- Start local time: 2026-07-03 15:44:50 -05:00
- End local time: 2026-07-03 15:48:51 -05:00
- Duration: approximately 4m

### Goal

- Revise the Markdown pipeline into a more detailed roadmap and make the data-structure, input/output, and function contracts clear, especially for the Phase 2.1 workspace/factorization layer.

### What changed

- docs/FULL_DEVELOPMENT_AND_VALIDATION_PIPELINE.md: updated the document to version 2.1 and added a detailed milestone roadmap. The new roadmap maps each phase to goal, inputs, outputs, data structures, functions, validation, and exit criteria. Phase 2.1 now explicitly documents `TorchOSQPWorkspace`, `DenseLUSolver`, `LinearSolveDiagnostics`, workspace invalidation, and factorization function contracts.
- docs/TORCH_OSQP_COMPLETION_AUDIT.md: added audit rows noting the roadmap and Phase 2.1 data contract as implemented documentation deliverables.
- output/pdf/Full Development and Validation Pipeline - Revised.pdf: regenerated the local PDF artifact from the updated Markdown.

### What was found

- The existing pipeline document was technically sound but read more like a final specification than a reviewer-facing roadmap.
- No Markdown section named exactly "Phase 2.1" was present before this edit, so the new Phase 2.1 section was inferred from the actual workspace and LU data model in the current source.
- The PDF renderer can handle the expanded roadmap and produced a 19-page document containing both "Milestone roadmap" and "Phase 2.1".

### Validation

- `rg -n "^#{1,6}\\s" docs\\FULL_DEVELOPMENT_AND_VALIDATION_PIPELINE.md`: confirmed heading order and renumbered sections.
- `rg -n "^(Inputs|Outputs|Data structures|Functions|Validation|Exit criteria|Primary data structures|Function contracts|Workspace input/output contract):" docs\\FULL_DEVELOPMENT_AND_VALIDATION_PIPELINE.md`: confirmed roadmap sections expose the requested contract fields.
- `python scripts\\render_pipeline_pdf.py`: passed and regenerated the local PDF.
- `git diff --check -- docs\\FULL_DEVELOPMENT_AND_VALIDATION_PIPELINE.md docs\\TORCH_OSQP_COMPLETION_AUDIT.md`: passed after removing trailing whitespace from updated version/date lines.
- `pypdf` extraction smoke check: confirmed the regenerated PDF has 19 pages and contains "Milestone roadmap" and "Phase 2.1".
- Full solver tests were not run because this was a documentation-only edit.

### Conclusion

- The Markdown now contains a roadmap-style milestone pipeline and a clear Phase 2.1 data-structure contract tied to the actual source-level classes, inputs, outputs, functions, validation checks, and exit criteria.

### Next steps

**Codex can proceed:**

- If requested, perform a visual PDF page-by-page review or commit and push the documentation update.

**Human reflection:**

- If you meant a different external "phase2.1" exemplar, compare that exemplar against the new Phase 2.1 section and decide whether the formatting should be adjusted further.

### Human action

- Review the new roadmap wording and confirm whether the inferred Phase 2.1 structure matches the style you wanted.

## Torch-OSQP plans directory correction

- Status: completed
- Start local time: 2026-07-03 16:35:03 -05:00
- End local time: 2026-07-03 16:49:59 -05:00
- Duration: approximately 15m

### Goal

- Create `docs/plans` planning files for the current PyGRANSO/Torch-OSQP project, using `C:/Users/1/Downloads/phase_2.1_plan.md` only as a style model and ignoring its browser-extension content.

### What changed

- docs/plans/README.md: replaced the incorrect Workspace Manager index with a PyGRANSO/Torch-OSQP plan index and clarified that the downloaded Phase 2.1 file is a style model only.
- docs/plans/roadmap.md: replaced the incorrect Workspace Manager roadmap with a Torch-OSQP dense reference roadmap containing numbered checkbox substeps such as `1.1.1`, `2.1.1`, and `5.1.5`.
- docs/plans/phase_0.1_archive_snapshot_plan.md: added archive snapshot plan with UML classes for git/archive evidence.
- docs/plans/phase_0.2_remove_research_paths_plan.md: added active-path cleanup plan with UML classes for legacy guards and removed features.
- docs/plans/phase_1.1_public_qp_contract_plan.md: added public QP contract plan with UML classes for PyGRANSO and canonical OSQP inputs.
- docs/plans/phase_1.2_backend_policy_and_fallback_plan.md: added backend selection/fallback plan with telemetry UML.
- docs/plans/phase_1.3_settings_validation_and_migration_plan.md: added settings, validation, and migration-error plan.
- docs/plans/phase_2.1_dense_lu_workspace_plan.md: added current-project Phase 2.1 workspace/LU plan without creating a local `phase_2.1_plan.md` duplicate.
- docs/plans/phase_2.2_direct_admm_kernel_plan.md: added direct ADMM kernel plan.
- docs/plans/phase_2.3_scaling_adaptive_polishing_plan.md: added scaling, adaptive-rho, polishing, and warm-start plan.
- docs/plans/phase_3.1_builtin_parity_plan.md: added builtin OSQP parity plan.
- docs/plans/phase_3.2_pygranso_integration_plan.md: added PyGRANSO integration plan.
- docs/plans/phase_4.1_tests_and_differential_plan.md: added deterministic, differential, metamorphic, and end-to-end test plan.
- docs/plans/phase_4.2_stability_evidence_plan.md: added stability evidence package plan.
- docs/plans/phase_4.3_platform_promotion_plan.md: added platform/backend promotion plan.
- docs/plans/phase_5.1_documentation_pdf_release_plan.md: added documentation, PDF, and release handoff plan.

### What was found

- The downloaded `roadmap.md` and `phase_2.1_plan.md` describe a different Workspace Manager browser-extension project, so their content was not appropriate for this repository.
- The useful part of the downloaded Phase 2.1 file is its planning style: existing assets, data structures, detailed UML-style classes, implementation checkboxes, validation, and exit criteria.
- A local file named `docs/plans/phase_2.1_plan.md` was intentionally not created, matching the clarification.

### Validation

- `rg -n "Workspace Manager|browser extension|ChatGPT|Claude|Gemini|Copilot|Extension Project|Orchestrator|Broadcast|Context Transfer|Side Panel|siteProfiles|chrome\\.storage|browser\\.tabs|AI website" docs\\plans`: no matches.
- Link-check script over `docs/plans/README.md` and `docs/plans/roadmap.md`: `missing_links=[]`.
- Plan inventory script: 14 `*_plan.md` files, `has_local_phase_2_1_plan=False`, `missing_uml=[]`, `missing_checkboxes=[]`.
- `git diff --check -- docs\\plans`: passed.
- Full solver tests were not run because this was documentation/planning-only.

### Conclusion

- `docs/plans` now contains current-project PyGRANSO/Torch-OSQP milestone plans, not Workspace Manager plans, and each plan follows the requested detailed Phase 2.1-style structure with UML class diagrams and checkbox steps.

### Next steps

**Codex can proceed:**

- Add cross-links from the main pipeline document to `docs/plans/roadmap.md` if you want the generated PDF/spec to advertise the new detailed plan package.

**Human reflection:**

- The plan files are intentionally implementation-oriented and evidence-aware; if you want them shorter for reviewers, we can produce a separate executive roadmap.

### Human action

- Review the `docs/plans` naming and milestone granularity to decide whether any milestone should be split even smaller.

## Torch-OSQP phase plan template rewrite

- Status: completed
- Start local time: 2026-07-03 17:05:00 -05:00 (approximate)
- End local time: 2026-07-03 17:30:24 -05:00
- Duration: approximately 25m

### Goal

- Rewrite all Torch-OSQP phase implementation plans under `docs/plans` to follow the attached `# Phase [X.X] Implementation Plan: [Feature Name]` template.

### What changed

- docs/plans/phase_0.1_archive_snapshot_plan.md: added the missing template `Class Diagram Rules` section while preserving the archive snapshot phase.
- docs/plans/phase_0.2_remove_research_paths_plan.md: added the missing template `Class Diagram Rules` section while preserving the research-path cleanup phase.
- docs/plans/phase_1.1_public_qp_contract_plan.md: added the missing template `Class Diagram Rules` section while preserving the public QP contract phase.
- docs/plans/phase_1.2_backend_policy_and_fallback_plan.md: completed the template structure for backend selection and fallback telemetry.
- docs/plans/phase_1.3_settings_validation_and_migration_plan.md: completed the template structure for common settings, validation, and legacy migration.
- docs/plans/phase_2.1_dense_lu_workspace_plan.md: completed the template structure for the workspace and reusable dense LU lifecycle.
- docs/plans/phase_2.2_direct_admm_kernel_plan.md: rewrote the phase into the template with ASCII diagrams for KKT assembly, ADMM iteration, and result construction.
- docs/plans/phase_2.3_scaling_adaptive_polishing_plan.md: rewrote the phase into the template with ASCII diagrams for scaling, adaptive rho, polishing, and warm starts.
- docs/plans/phase_3.1_builtin_parity_plan.md: rewrote the phase into the template with ASCII diagrams for common settings, parity metrics, and differential comparison.
- docs/plans/phase_3.2_pygranso_integration_plan.md: rewrote the phase into the template with ASCII diagrams for QP requests, BFGS-SQP integration, and fallback contracts.
- docs/plans/phase_4.1_tests_and_differential_plan.md: rewrote the phase into the template with ASCII diagrams for unit, differential, metamorphic, and end-to-end gates.
- docs/plans/phase_4.2_stability_evidence_plan.md: rewrote the phase into the template with ASCII diagrams for case results, manifests, failure bundles, and summaries.
- docs/plans/phase_4.3_platform_promotion_plan.md: rewrote the phase into the template with ASCII diagrams for support matrix entries, promotion records, hardware gates, and performance gates.
- docs/plans/phase_5.1_documentation_pdf_release_plan.md: rewrote the phase into the template with ASCII diagrams for documentation sources, PDF artifacts, audit entries, and code-edit reports.

### What was found

- The later phase files still used Mermaid `classDiagram` blocks from the earlier plan style; the attached template calls for explicit implementation-plan sections and ASCII-style diagrams.
- The first six rewritten phase files were already mostly in the new template shape but lacked the exact `## Class Diagram Rules` heading.
- The generated plan directory still correctly avoided the unrelated Workspace Manager/browser-extension content and did not create `docs/plans/phase_2.1_plan.md`.

### Validation

- Required-heading scan over all `docs/plans/*_plan.md`: 14 phase files, no missing template headings, no missing ASCII diagram markers.
- `rg -n "classDiagram|```mermaid" docs\\plans`: no matches.
- `rg -n "Workspace Manager|browser extension|ChatGPT|Claude|Gemini|Copilot|Extension Project|Orchestrator|Broadcast|Context Transfer|Side Panel|siteProfiles|chrome\\.storage|browser\\.tabs|AI website" docs\\plans`: no matches.
- `Test-Path docs\\plans\\phase_2.1_plan.md`: `False`.
- Link-check script over `docs/plans/README.md` and `docs/plans/roadmap.md`: no missing links.
- `git diff --check -- docs\\plans`: passed.
- Full solver tests were not run because this was a documentation/planning-format rewrite only.

### Conclusion

- All 14 Torch-OSQP phase plan files now follow the attached implementation-plan template with current-project content, required sections, ASCII diagrams, validation rules, testing checklists, and acceptance criteria.

### Next steps

**Codex can proceed:**

- If requested, align the main pipeline document and completion audit with the new `docs/plans` phase filenames and template language.

**Human reflection:**

- The current plans are engineering-spec oriented; if a reviewer-facing shorter plan package is useful, we can generate a separate concise roadmap from these same phases.

### Human action

- Review the new plan style and confirm whether the ASCII diagram density is the level you want before we use it as the standard for future implementation tasks.

## Torch-OSQP decision-complete roadmap rewrite

- Status: completed
- Start local time: 2026-07-04 00:05:46 -05:00
- End local time: 2026-07-04 00:12:41 -05:00
- Duration: approximately 7m

### Goal

- Apply the user's full development and validation pipeline template as the project roadmap, adapting it carefully to the current PyGRANSO Torch-OSQP dense reference implementation, prior pipeline, completion audit, and edit-log evidence.

### What changed

- docs/plans/roadmap.md: replaced the compact checkbox roadmap with a decision-complete project roadmap covering executive decision, acceptance envelope, backend support matrix, outcome policy, risks, architecture, public/canonical contracts, ASCII class/module diagrams, workspace and dense-LU lifecycles, preserved equations, numerical features, defaults, backend fallback, validation pipeline, evidence package, performance gate, milestone status, migration sequence, decision log, and future work.
- docs/plans/roadmap.md: marked only audit/log-supported work as completed and left release/promotion blockers unchecked, including workflow registration, CUDA promotion, and ROCm/MPS runner acquisition.
- docs/plans/README.md: adjusted wording from UML-style to ASCII-style class/module details and described `roadmap.md` as the decision-complete roadmap.

### What was found

- `docs/FULL_DEVELOPMENT_AND_VALIDATION_PIPELINE.md` already contained most of the decision-complete technical contract, including the dense Torch route, `n + m <= 2400`, reusable PyTorch LU, OSQP equations, defaults, fallback policy, evidence package, and 5x performance gate.
- `docs/TORCH_OSQP_COMPLETION_AUDIT.md` shows dense LU, workspace state, ADMM equations, numerical features, public policy, fallback telemetry, deterministic tests, local CPU evidence, and documentation deliverables are implemented/evidenced, while CUDA remains unpromoted and ROCm/MPS remain unclaimed.
- The existing `docs/plans` phase filenames stop at Phase 5.1, so the roadmap keeps backend promotion as Phase 4.3 and documentation/release handoff as Phase 5.1 rather than inventing new unlinked Phase 6 files.

### Validation

- Placeholder scan for unresolved template markers in `docs/plans/roadmap.md` and `docs/plans/README.md`: no matches.
- Mermaid/unrelated-content scan over `docs/plans`: no matches.
- Local link-check script over `docs/plans/README.md` and `docs/plans/roadmap.md`: `link_problems=[]`.
- `git diff --check -- docs\\plans`: passed.
- Direct inspection confirmed `docs/plans/roadmap.md` now starts with version/date/status metadata and Section 20 contains checked implemented items plus unchecked release/promotion blockers.
- Full solver tests were not run because this was a documentation/roadmap rewrite only.

### Conclusion

- `docs/plans/roadmap.md` now applies the user's roadmap template to the actual PyGRANSO Torch-OSQP project and reflects current implemented, evidenced, and still-blocked work without expanding scope or overclaiming accelerator support.

### Next steps

**Codex can proceed:**

- If requested, align `docs/FULL_DEVELOPMENT_AND_VALIDATION_PIPELINE.md` with the new roadmap wording or regenerate the PDF from the updated roadmap package.

**Human reflection:**

- The roadmap now marks implemented items based on the audit/log; if you prefer `docs/plans/roadmap.md` to be purely forward-looking, we can revert the checked items to unchecked and keep implementation status only in the audit.

### Human action

- Review the checked/unchecked roadmap status, especially the conservative accelerator-promotion blockers, before using it as the release-facing roadmap.

## Torch-OSQP release-readiness package sync

- Status: completed
- Start local time: 2026-07-04 00:29:19 -05:00
- End local time: 2026-07-04 00:32:21 -05:00
- Duration: approximately 3m

### Goal

- Preserve and sync the release-readiness documentation package so the main pipeline, audit, roadmap, PDF, and external Report tracker agree before PR/workflow work.

### What changed

- docs/FULL_DEVELOPMENT_AND_VALIDATION_PIPELINE.md: updated version/date/status to 2.2 / 2026-07-04 / release-candidate specification with accelerator promotion gated; linked `docs/plans/roadmap.md` as the checked/unchecked release-readiness status source; added `docs/plans` and the external Report tracker to the documentation handoff artifacts.
- docs/TORCH_OSQP_COMPLETION_AUDIT.md: updated the audit date, named `docs/plans/roadmap.md` as the status source linking to 14 phase plans, and added the external release-readiness tracker row.
- output/pdf/Full Development and Validation Pipeline - Revised.pdf: regenerated locally from the updated pipeline Markdown; the artifact did not appear as a tracked Git change.
- F:/UMN Researches/Ju Research/Report/2026-07-04_pygranso_torch_osqp_release_tracking.md: updated with this same high-level work-session result.

### What was found

- The main pipeline was still versioned 2.1 / 2026-07-03 and did not explicitly reference the new `docs/plans` release checklist package.
- The audit already had the correct conservative backend status but did not name the external Report tracker.
- The generated PDF still renders as 19 pages and includes the expected release-facing sections.

### Validation

- `git status --short --branch`: confirmed the release-package scope is documentation/plans/log changes; no solver source files changed.
- `git diff --check`: passed after removing one trailing-space date line in the audit; only a pre-existing CRLF warning for `.codex/code-edit-log.md` remained.
- Local link-check script for `docs/plans/README.md` and `docs/plans/roadmap.md`: `link_problems=[]`.
- Placeholder scan for unresolved template tokens in roadmap/pipeline/audit: no matches.
- Mermaid/unrelated-content scan over plans/pipeline/audit: no matches.
- Conservative support scan confirmed CUDA remains unpromoted and ROCm/MPS remain unclaimed in roadmap, pipeline, and audit.
- `python scripts\\render_pipeline_pdf.py`: passed and regenerated the local PDF.
- PDF smoke check with `pypdf`: 19 pages; TOC, support matrix, risk table, roadmap, decision log, `docs/plans/roadmap.md`, and gated accelerator status were found.
- Full solver/stability suites were not run because this was a documentation/release-package stabilization step only.

### Conclusion

- The release-readiness package is synchronized: the main pipeline points to the new plan package, the audit records the status source and tracker, the PDF was regenerated and smoke-checked, and backend promotion remains conservatively blocked.

### Next steps

**Codex can proceed:**

- Prepare the clean commit/PR handoff scope and then update or open the release PR when requested.

**Human reflection:**

- Decide whether the external Report tracker should be committed separately, copied into the repo, or kept as a local research notebook outside git.

### Human action

- Review the intended commit scope before PR work: `docs/plans/`, pipeline/audit docs, `.codex/code-edit-log.md`, and optionally the external Report tracker.

## Torch-OSQP release diff review and staging

- Status: completed
- Start local time: 2026-07-05 18:30:00 -05:00
- End local time: 2026-07-05 18:36:41 -05:00
- Duration: approximately 7m

### Goal

- Review the release-package diff and prepare the intended documentation package for commit/PR handoff without including local evidence artifacts or the external Report notebook.

### What changed

- docs/plans/roadmap.md: removed trailing spaces from the metadata lines so `git diff --check` passes.
- Repository index: staged the intended release-package files after validation.

### What was found

- The diff scope contains documentation/plans/log changes only: `.codex/code-edit-log.md`, the main pipeline, the completion audit, and 16 files under `docs/plans`.
- No solver source files, local stability artifacts, or external Report notebook files are part of the repository diff.
- `docs/plans` was already in Git intent-to-add state, so it appeared in `git diff` as added files.

### Validation

- `git diff --stat`: 19 files, 5763 insertions, 22 deletions before staging.
- `git diff --check`: passed after trimming roadmap metadata trailing spaces; the only message was the existing CRLF warning for `.codex/code-edit-log.md`.
- Local link-check script for `docs/plans/README.md` and `docs/plans/roadmap.md`: `link_problems=[]`.
- Placeholder scan for unresolved template tokens in roadmap/pipeline/audit: no matches.
- Mermaid/unrelated-content scan over plans/pipeline/audit: no matches.
- Conservative support scan confirmed CUDA remains unpromoted and ROCm/MPS remain unclaimed.
- Full solver/stability tests were not run because this was a diff review and documentation-staging step only.

### Conclusion

- The release-package diff is reviewed, clean, and staged for commit/PR handoff while keeping the external Report tracker outside git.

### Next steps

**Codex can proceed:**

- Commit the staged release-package documentation changes and prepare PR notes if requested.

**Human reflection:**

- The staged package is documentation-heavy by design; consider whether `.codex/code-edit-log.md` should remain part of the PR or be squashed/handled separately according to project norms.

### Human action

- Review the staged diff once more before committing or opening/updating the PR.
